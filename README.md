# COMPSCI-589-Final_Project

## Instructions on Running Code

The main code is located in src/src.py and all relevant helper functions are located in src/misc.py. To run the program simply run

`python3 src.py`

At the bottom of src.py, there are 4 functions that we use: `test_loans()`, `test_digits()`, `test_parkinsons()`, and `test_titanic()`. The parameters passed in to these funtions are num_folds and num_trees, respectively, and other fine-tuning of algorithms is done inside the methods themselves. 

For creating the lurning curves, the code is commented out in each respective method and implementation of the testing code can be found in misc.py.
